# Employee-Retention-Analysis

**Summary:** The project aims to address the problem of high turnover rate among employees for Salifort Motors. By analyzing their survey data and designing predictive models, I, as a fictional data professional, identified key factors driving turnover and proposed solutions to enhance retention and save costs.

**Why this project** 
This project is a Capstone project of Google Advanced Data Analytics specialization. The Specialization consists of 7 courses, and this capstone project is the very last project to get the certification from Google. So, I have been excited about this project. It allowed me to apply skills gathered from the whole program, including Python, EDA, Data visualizations, statistics, Machine Learning Modeling, PACE workflow, etc.  In addition, I was also responsible for solving a particular business problem in an imaginary organizational setup such as setting up the team’s workflow, creating a project proposal, interacting with a variety of internal and external stakeholders, and sharing insights & final recommendations through an executive summary. 

**About the Company**
Salifort Motors is a (fictional) French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.    


**Business Case Scenario**
“As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked me with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like me to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful.”

**Stakeholders:** defining the stakeholders of a data project is a crucial and very elementary step to begin with. We must know the stakeholders and audiences so that we can follow a chain of command to ask for additional queries or resources, which saves time and confusion. For this particular project, only the senior leadership team is interested to see the output, so they are the stakeholders. 

**Project Goal:** The goal is to identify the factors that are affecting employees of the company for high turnover rate, then analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

**Required resources: Dataset, Python Notebook, any additional input from stakeholders**

**Solution:**
I used Jupyter Notebook to code in Python. I completed the project in 4 steps: 
1. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
2.  Analysis of variables, 
3. Building Machine Learning Models
4. Evaluation, Summarize results and Recommendations.
